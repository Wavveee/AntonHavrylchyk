                <h2 id="introduction"> INTRODUCTION<span>Chapter 1</span></h2>

                <p>
                    Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking for environment setup
                    instructions,
                    they've moved to <span class="underline-text">their own section.</span> Continue reading for an
                    introduction to the documentation, Native
                    Components, React, and more!
                </p>

                <h2 id="core components">CORE COMPONENTS<span>Chapter 2</span></h2>

                <p>
                    React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and
                    the
                    app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs
                    APIs as
                    well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components:<span class="italic-text"> bundles of reusable,
                        nestable code.</span> You can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover
                    how components work in React Native.
                </p>

                <hr>
                <h2 id="react fundamentals">REACT FUNDAMENTALS<span>Chapter 3</span></h2>

                <p>
                    React Native runs on <span class="underline-text">React</span>, a popular open source library for
                    building user interfaces with JavaScript.
                    To
                    make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get you started
                    or
                    can
                    serve as a refresher course.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="bold-text">+ components.</span> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its
                    examples: friendly, approachable
                    creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="bold-text">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX , a syntax that lets you write
                    elements inside JavaScript like so:
                    <span class="background-text"> &lt;Text&gt; Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;. </span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The React docs have <span class="underline-text"> a comprehensive guide to JSX </span>you can refer
                    to learn even more. Because JSX is
                    JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a<span class="background-text">
                        name </span> for the cat, name, and
                    embedding
                    it with curly braces inside <span class="background-text"> &lt;Text&gt; </span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="bold-text">+ props.</span> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="bold-text">+ state.</span> While you can think of props as arguments you use to
                    configure how components render, state is
                    like
                    a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time or
                    that
                    comes
                    from user interaction. State gives your components memory!
                </p>

                <hr>
                <h2 id="handling text input">HANDLING TEXT INPUT<span>Chapter 3</span></h2>

                <p>
                    TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an <span
                        class="italic-text">onChangeText</span> prop that takes
                    a
                    function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function
                    to
                    be
                    called when the text is submitted.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different
                    language.
                    In
                    this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there Bob"
                    would be
                    translated as "üçï üçï".
